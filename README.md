    2. Communication with IPCA's systems for email validation
    3. Student Profile (with photo and relevant information)
    4. Access to Course information (course, units enrolled)
    5. Access to Timetable
    6. Use of Map for student location (confirm you are in the campus of the IPCA CAMPUS)
    7. Use of PushNotifications to alert of class time to access/register

  work EVEN without or with weak internet.
  
Delivery:
  1. APK file (compiled) of the application
  2. Source code of the application
  3. Simple PDF report on how the application works
